      <p>
        I was born in Tennessee but grew up in Florida. While in High School I
        was active in soccer, cross country, track and field, color guard,
        orchestra, and several other activities. I attended college at Flordia
        Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers where I majored in Biology; after a
        year I moved back to Tennessee to be closer to family. Six years later I
        married my wonderful husband Josh and we have four obnoxiously amazing
        fur babies: Mollie, Shiloh, Ranger, and Erza.

        I got into coding because of a love for computers and all things
        technology. I have been doing simple coding work on my own for a few
        years on and off. I really am looking forward to honing my skills and
        learning additional things durning this coding bootcamp.
