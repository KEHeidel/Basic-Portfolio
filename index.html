        <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
        <p>
            I was born in Tennessee but grew up in Florida. While in High School I was active in soccer, cross country,
            track and field, color guard, orchestra, and several other activities. I attended college at Flordia Gulf
            Coast University in Fort Myers where I majored in Biology; after a year I moved back to Tennessee to be
            closer to family. Six years later I married my wonderful husband Josh and we have four obnoxiously amazing
            fur babies: Mollie, Shiloh, Ranger, and Erza.
